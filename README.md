# Guess Who

My digital version of the old character guessing board game -> Guess Who? I enjoyed working on this project even when sometimes it was hard to deal with challenges. After all, I built my own game for the first time! 

## What I learned

After this week's struggles of solving problems, I concluded that it's better to ask for help sooner than later. It can save a lot of time and with that time I can do other things for my project. After this week I realized how important Google and StackOverflow are to get help.  
 
Thanks to that project I've learned a lot about: 
- comparing two different object 
- use filter function to an array 
- use audio tags in the HTML and manipulate with them in JS
- dived in more into window onload function and how it works
- how to add a small icon in the title tab in the browser 
- how to create a modal window 

Useful Links that I used in the project: 

- Cut audio files: https://mp3cut.net/

- Free sounds effect to downloud: https://www.freesfx.com/
