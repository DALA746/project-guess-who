# Guess Who

For this week project I have to create my own digital version of the old character guessing board game -> Guess Who? 

## What I learned

After this week struggles of solving problems I came to conclusion that it's better to ask for help sononer then later. It can save a lot of time and with that time I can do other things to my project. 
 

Thanks to that project I've learned a lot about: 
- comparing two different object 
- use filter function to an array 
- use audio tags in the HTML and manipulate with them in JS
- dived in more into window onload function and how it works
- how to add a small icon in the title tab in the browser 
- how to create a modal window 

What I want to add more to my project: 
- create confirm window and style it 
- confetti should only when you win 
- at the end of the game show the score of users guesses
